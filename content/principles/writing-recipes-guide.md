## Core Principles

### 1. Flexibility Over Precision
- Focus on techniques and ratios rather than exact measurements
- Acknowledge that ingredients can be adjusted based on needs and resources
- Explain what's essential vs. what's adaptable

### 2. Accessibility
- Consider multiple constraints:
  - Cost and availability of ingredients
  - Time and energy required
  - Kitchen equipment needed
  - Dietary restrictions
  - Storage capabilities
- Provide alternatives for common constraints

### 3. Educational Approach
- Explain techniques that can be applied broadly
- Include the reasoning behind key steps
- Highlight decision points and their impacts

## Recipe Structure

### Introduction
1. Brief overview of what the dish is
2. Why it's useful (adaptable, quick, affordable, etc.)
3. Core technique or principle that makes it work
4. Historical or practical context if relevant (e.g., traditional methods of stretching ingredients)

### Base Recipe
1. Simplest tested version
2. Clear, step-by-step instructions
3. Key technique points
4. Visual or tactile cues for success
5. Notes about what to expect during cooking

### Adaptations and Variations
Organize modifications by category:
1. Core ingredient substitutions
2. Dietary modifications
3. Equipment alternatives
4. Scaling guidance
5. Cost-saving options

### Cost Considerations
- Discuss flexible ratios for stretching expensive ingredients
- Provide protein alternatives at different price points
- Include shopping and storage strategies
- Note bulk cooking possibilities

### Storage and Reheating
- Clear storage instructions
- How to scale up for batch cooking
- Reheating methods
- Quality expectations after storage

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Language
- Use clear, direct instructions
- Avoid assuming kitchen experience level
- Explain cooking terms that might not be universal
- Include sensory cues (what to look, listen, or feel for)

### Measurements
- Provide both volume and weight when relevant
- Include visual equivalents when possible
- Explain ratio-based measurements for scaling

### Organization
- Group similar information together
- Use consistent formatting for:
  - Ingredients
  - Steps
  - Notes and variations
  - Tips and warnings

## Special Considerations

### Equipment Notes
- List basic equipment needed
- Provide alternatives for specialized tools
- Include workarounds for common limitations

### Ingredient Notes
- Explain key characteristics needed in substitutions
- Note when ingredient quality significantly impacts results
- Include information about seasonal availability
- Mention shelf-stable alternatives

### Safety Considerations
- Note critical food safety points
- Explain how to test for doneness
- Include storage safety guidelines
- Mention common pitfalls to avoid

## Testing and Documentation

### Recipe Testing
- Test base version thoroughly
- Document likely variations even if not tested
- Note which variations have been tested vs. theoretical
- Include feedback from different contexts when available

### Photography and Presentation
- Focus on process shots over "perfect" final presentation
- Show realistic results
- Include variations when possible
- Demonstrate key techniques or decision points

### Feedback Integration
- Plan for community input
- Document successful adaptations
- Note regional or cultural variations
- Update based on user experiences
