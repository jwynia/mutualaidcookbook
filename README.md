# Mutual Aid Cookbook

A cookbook focused on practical, adaptable recipes and techniques to support cooking in various contexts and constraints. Whether you're cooking for yourself during low-energy periods, preparing meals for neighbors in need, or organizing community cooking projects, this cookbook provides flexible approaches that work across different situations.

## Core Philosophy

This cookbook approaches cooking through the lens of mutual support and practical flexibility. It recognizes that:

- Everyone's needs, resources, and constraints are different and valid
- Traditional recipes often assume specific resources, abilities, and contexts
- Cooking knowledge should be shared in ways that empower adaptation
- Food is fundamentally about caring for ourselves and others
